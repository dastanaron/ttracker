GO GUI(GTK) MINI TASK TRACKER
==========================

This is a very simple time tracker, in case the Internet does not work or it is unsafe to use cloud versions. I wrote it for myself, but I do not mind sharing it with you.

To download, just use the [Releases tab](./releases).
I compiled the version only for Linux, but if you want, you can compile it for other platforms.

The project is created on [Wails](https://wails.io/)
